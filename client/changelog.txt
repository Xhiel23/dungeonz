18/07/2020 - Update 6 - Dungeon instances
New:
- Dungeon instances
    - Every dungeon that you enter is now separate from all others of that same dungeon, meaning it will be for only you and whoever you enter with. Other players cannot enter that instance after the dungeon has started.
    - The dungeon interface now allows you to create a party for other players to join.
    - Only the party creator must pay the entry cost.
    - Creatures and item pickups in dungeons do not respawn.
    - Dropped items in dungeons do not disappear after a while.
    - Added a max players limit.
    - Added a time limit to leave the dungeon.
    - Removed key pickups for locked doors. Now all keys found from killing the key holders are added to a shared set of party keys, that can be used by anyone in the party.
    - Adjusted each dungeon to work with this new party key system.
    - Disabled PvP in dungeons.
- Defence rework
    - The damage reduction percentage is now based on a how many defence points you have (from wearing armour, etc.). Each defence point gives you +1% effective HP. So with 100 you can take 2x the damage before dying.
    - Some weapons can now deal armour piercing type damage, which will ignore a percentage of the defence points of the target.
- Damage types
    - Each source of damage now comes in types. The types of damage that something deals determines how/if it can interact with the target. Certain creatures can be immune to some types of damage, such as ghosts being immune to physical attacks.
    - Physical: Solid objects, such as swords, arrows and melee attacks.
    - Magical: Magic related things, like fireballs, wind blasts, curses.
    - Biological: Organic related things, like disease and poison effects, and possibly environmental effects like heat and cold.
- Added dwarfs
- Some bosses can now also be found on the overworld, outside of dungeons.

Other:
- Removed Widgetbot

Also changed a while ago, forgot to do release notes for it.
- Added mage tower area
- Added mage training arena dungeon
- Added Mage mobs.
- Fixed various GUI display sizing issues on Firefox.
- Removed the continue code system. Replaced it with an actual permanent account system with username and password. Accounts/characters no longer "expire" after not being played for a while.


20/05/2019 - Update 5 - Forest maze
New:
- Forest maze
    - Master tier dungeon that is quite long.
    - New tree type enemies.
- Combat rework
    - Damage amounts have been greatly increased for all damage sources.
    - Hitpoint amounts have been greatly increased for all creatures.
    - Player character now have 2x the hitpoints of a citizen. You have a much larger pool of initial hitpoints, so it is harder to die too quickly, but also means healing to full will take longer.
    - Clothing (armour, robes, etc.) now gives a percent damage reduction.
    - Clothing durability is reduced by 25% of raw damage taken.
- Tasks rework
    - Tasks now come in 3 categories; Kill, Gather, Craft
    - You will always have 2 tasks from each category, 6 tasks in total. Completing a task will give you another random one from the same category.
    - Tasks are given a random length, short/medium/long, which determines how many of a thing you need to do, and how many items/how much glory are given as the reward.
    - The range of different tasks is now much larger.
- Missing stat purposes
    - The melee, ranged, magic and gathering stats now affect the chance that when you use an item related to those stats (such as attacking with a staff or using a pickaxe) that the item will not lose any durability. Every level gives a 1% chance that the item can be used without it losing durability.

Bugs:
- Probably...

Balance:
- Tweaks to the tutorial area to get people through it a bit faster.
- Stat level cap 20 -> 50
- Bandits now use iron daggers instead of iron swords.

    - Ninja garb
- Book of light price 800 -> 1000
- Health and energy potions price 150 -> 200


28/04/2019 - Update 4 - Shadow dōjō:
The mysterious deaths and disappearances of many notable figures throughout the lands has struck worry into the knights of Munud City. Reports suggest this is unlikely to be the work of common bandits, but instead a more highly trained and dangerous form of outlaw. A new fighting arena has recently finished construction in the dock area of the city, where adventurers can improve their combat skill against each other, in preparation for seeking out this new cunning foe...
New:
- Shadow dōjō
    - Master tier dungeon, 2000 Glory entry cost.
    - The first enemies with a special attack that they can use to be more of a threat to players. Special attacks for existing creatures will come in future updates.
- Fight arena: The dock area of the city (where the boat to the vampire island is) now has a PvP arena, where community PvP events can be held.
    - Fighter key: Sold by the arena master at the arena entrance, which can be used to enter the preparation area below the fight pit.
    - Pit key: Spawns in the fight pit (the walled area in the middle of the arena), which can be used to exit the pit.

- Depositing an item into your bank using the up arrow icons on the inventory bar will now add it to the selected bank tab, instead of the first tab with an empty slot.
- Withdrawing items from the bank using drag and drop now withdraws it from the slot on the correct tab, instead of always taking from the matching slot on the first tab.
- Fixed being able to go over the stat level cap if you joined the game with more than the level cap's worth of exp.
- Player controlled zombies can no longer damage other players in safe zones. Also, claimed zombies now inherit the faction of their master, so player controlled zombies become classed as citizens and won't automatically attack or be attacked by citizens or city guards.
- Pushing effects (wind staff, hammers) can no longer push players in a safe zone.
- Key dropping creatures in dungeons now only drop 1 key.
- Key dropping creatures in dungeons now force respawn at their intended area when the boss respawns, to avoid them getting stuck behind locked doors for which their own key is needed to get past.
- Fixed dungeon portals (and other interactable objects) not appearing in the right state when you enter an area with them in.
- Fixed (hopefully) the player character log in duplication glitch.

Balance:

    - Cured: Makes you immune to poison for a while.
    - Health regeneration: Heals slowly over time. Caused by walking through a blood pool, or using a health potion.
